# Falconi Cybersecurity Project
*Developed during my Summer 2025 Cybersecurity Internship at Solutions³ LLC*

This repository showcases a full-scale cybersecurity engagement for the simulated client **Falconi Sports Agency**, built during my internship with **Solutions³ LLC**.  
The project simulates how a security team would establish foundational policies, build response capabilities, and manage risk in a real-world organization.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The project is organized into three major security pathways, each delivered over multiple weeks and concluding with a pathway overview:
