# Falconi Cybersecurity Project
*Developed during my Summer 2025 Cybersecurity Internship at Solutions³ LLC*

This repository showcases a full-scale cybersecurity engagement for the simulated client **Falconi Sports Agency**, built during my internship with **Solutions³ LLC**.  
The project simulates how a security team would establish foundational policies, build response capabilities, and manage risk in a real-world organization.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The project is organized into three major security pathways, each delivered over multiple weeks and concluding with a pathway overview:

## 🧩 Pathway Summaries

### 🛡️ Enterprise Cyber Essentials Framework
- Built a complete security foundation aligned with **CISA Cyber Essentials** and **NIST CSF**
- Created onboarding policies, MFA setup guides, access control framework, data classification policy, backup plan
- Delivered phishing training that reduced click rate from **66% to 0%**

### 🚨 CISA/NIST-Aligned Incident Response Program
- Designed and implemented a full **Incident Response (IR)** capability following **CISA** and **NIST 800-61r2**
- Authored IR playbook, escalation tiers, report templates, and ran tabletop simulations
- Conducted Wireshark-based PCAP analysis (TCP intrusion, FTP brute-force/exfiltration)

### ⚖️ Risk Management & Vulnerability Assessment Framework
- Applied **NIST RMF** principles to identify, score, and mitigate risks
- Produced OSINT recon reports, Nessus/Scorecard scans, and network traffic analysis (ARP spoofing, ICMP tunneling, XSS)
- Maintained a live risk register mapping technical risks to business impact
